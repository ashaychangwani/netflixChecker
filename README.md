# netflixChecker
This program is being created for educational purposes only. It allows the user to specify email:password combinations and a list of proxies, and it checks whether a Netflix account with these credentials exists, and if yes, what are the details of the account (Plan and expiry).

Import the .cs file in Visual Studio and add the xNet-Ameliorated.dll file as an external library. Edit the batch file to modify the locations of the two other files and run it in order to get a working .exe file of the checker. 
The checker automatically selects the source file and the file with the proxy lists. Edit them or create a dialog box in order to modify those values according to your files. 

For proxies, I would recommend using: http://www.vipsocks24.net/
